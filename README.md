## Travis Badge

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kgamer007/31-redux-budget-tracker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/kgamer007/31-redux-budget-tracker)

So this lab is about implementing redux into a budget tracker. The Redux itself manages the state of the budget category listing app, which contains an array of objects.

The components are app, category-form, category-item and landing.

app: is used to initiate any routes to the landing page.
category-form: is used to create and update upon submit of a new entry. 
category-item: A wrapper component of category-form.
landing: is what builds the actual page. 
expense-form: is a component to create expenses of the category. 
expense-item: A wrapper component of expense-form.
